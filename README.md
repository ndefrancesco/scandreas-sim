# scandreas-sim
An interactive simulator for the **scandreas** scanning setup (and related mirror-laser-y stuff), written in Processing.

The **scandreas** setup was conceived by Andreas Boden, Andrea Volpato, Kayley Hake, Andrew York and Ilaria Testa, 
and was presented by @AndrewGYork in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewGYork/status/1222319044755197952), which can be referenced using https://zenodo.org/record/3653386 .

This simulator started out of curiosity, and as an excersise, to try to undertand the workings and properties of the setup in an interactive manner, and grew as new ideas and concepts were discussed in the thread that unfolded from the original tweet.

Feel free to play with it and modify as you like!


## Documentation:

### Installation:
- Just download the `scandreas_sim/` folder, and open and run `scandreas_sim.pde` in the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/).

### Basic usage:
Upon start, the user is presented with a canvas with several objects: three mirrors and a laser source. At any time, the active object will be marked with a red circle.

#### Mirrors
Each mirror has a reflective (gray) and a non-reflective (black) side, and can be repositioned by clicking and dragging from the center dot. 
A mirror can be rotated by clicking and dragging near either end. While dragging, the cursor can be moved away from the mirror to achieve better precision.

The mirror marked with a red dot scans back and forth (default range = +/- 2Â°)


#### Laser
The laser source can be moved in a similar way as the mirrors. The beam of the laser can be redirected by clicking on the first ray segment (before any bounce/hit) and dragging.

The beam path has regularly spaced markings along its (unfolded) length.

#### Measurements

The canvas is scaled in millimeters (mm). The default mirror width is 50 mm.

On the bottom of the window, the following information is provided:
- Angle of the exit beam, and the angle that it forms with the input beam (in parenthesis).
- Beam path length difference: this is the difference bethween the minimal length and the current length, always measured from the source to either: 1) an off-screen target that is a fixed distance from the canvas center and always perpendicular to the exit beam, 2) a terminating point, i.e. it hits the back of a mirror. Following any change in the ray path, this quantity will only be meaningful after a full scan cycle has elapsed. The corresponding scan angle is shown in parenthesis.
- Scan width: it is the distance between the end positions in a full scan, measured perpendicular to the exit beam. This measurement only makes sense if the exit beam has no angular scan component (i.e.: the exit angle is constant).
